            <p>Due to a plethora of accusations that Destiny is simply a wiki-warrior, I thought about making this website to track if that's true. It is meant to be a crowd-sourced clip tracker of all the research he has done.</p>

            <h1>Linking with Orvods</h1>
            <p>This website provides links to watch clips on <a href="https://vyneer.me/vods" target="_blank">Orvods</a> to watch clips with an audience. Orvods also provides links to alternative sites like Kick or Rumble to watch clips that may be unavailable on YouTube.</p>
