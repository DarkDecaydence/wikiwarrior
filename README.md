# WikiWarrior

Introducing WikiWarrior, a project to document all of Destiny's research and answer the question:

> Is Destiny really a wiki-warrior?

It provides a table of research that Destiny has done. This hopes to include Israel/Palestine, January 6, Immigration, Russia/Ukraine, RedPill, and many others.

## Features

- Built-in clip player
